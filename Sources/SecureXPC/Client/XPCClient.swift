/// An XPC client to make requests and receive responses from an ``XPCServer``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Client For a Service
/// There are two different types of services you can communicate with using this client: XPC services and XPC Mach services. If you are uncertain which type of
/// service you're using, it's likely an XPC service.
///
/// #### XPC services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// The name of the service must be specified when retrieving a client to talk to your XPC service; this is always the bundle identifier for the service:
/// ```swift
/// let client = XPCClient.forXPCService(named: "com.example.myapp.service")
/// ```
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
/// XPC Mach services are frequently provided by:
/// - Helper tools installed with
/// [  `SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless)
/// - Login items enabled with
/// [`SMLoginItemSetEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1501557-smloginitemsetenabled)
/// - Launch Agents
/// - Launch Daemons
///
/// The name of the service must be specified when retrieving a client to talk to your XPC Mach service:
/// ```swift
/// let client = XPCClient.forXPCMachService(named: "com.example.service")
/// ```
///
/// ## Retrieving a Client For an Anonymous Server
/// Clients can also be created from an ``XPCServerEndpoint`` which is the only way to create a client for an anonymous server:
/// ```swift
/// let server = XPCServer.makeAnonymous()
/// let client = XPCClient.forEndpoint(server.endpoint)
/// ```
///
/// ### Sending Requests with Async
/// Once a client has been retrieved, sending a request is as simple as invoking `send` with a route:
/// ```swift
/// let resetRoute = XPCRoute.named("reset")
/// try await client.send(to: resetRoute)
/// ```
///
/// If the client needs to receive information back from the server, a route with a reply type must be used:
/// ```swift
/// let currentRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "current")
///                            .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = try await client.send(to: currentRoute)
/// ```
///
/// Routes can also require a message be included in the request:
/// ```swift
/// let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                           .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                           .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = <# create Config instance #>
/// let updatedConfig = try await client.sendMessage(config, to: updateRoute)
/// ```
///
/// Alternatively, routes can return an asynchronous sequence of replies:
/// ```swift
/// let changesRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "changes")
///                            .withSequentialReplyType(Config.self)
/// let configStream = client.send(to: changesRoute)
/// for try await latestConfig in configStream {
///     <#do something with Config instance #>
/// }
/// ```
/// Whether a sequence ever finishes is determined by the implementation registered with the server or if a client side error occurs during decoding.
///
/// ### Sending Requests with Closures
/// Closure-based versions of these functions also exist to provide support for macOS 10.14 and earlier:
/// ```swift
/// let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                           .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                           .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = <# create Config instance #>
/// client.sendMessage(config, to: updateRoute, withResponse: { response in
///     switch response {
///          case .success(let reply):
///              <# use the reply #>
///          case .failure(let error):
///              <# handle the error #>
///     }
/// })
/// ```
///
/// For these closure-based functions, the ``XPCClient/XPCResponseHandler`` provided as the `withResponse` or `onCompletion` parameter is
/// always passed a [`Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) with the `Success` value matching the route's
/// `replyType` (or `Void` if there is no reply) and a `Failure` of type ``XPCError``. If an error was thrown by the server while handling the request, it will
/// be provided as an ``XPCError`` on failure.
///
/// Closure-based functions also exist for sequential responses:
///```swift
/// let changesRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "changes")
///                            .withSequentialReplyType(Config.self)
/// let configStream = client.send(to: changesRoute, withSequentialResponse: { response in
///     switch response {
///         case .success(let reply):
///             <# use the reply #>
///         case .failure(let error):
///             <# handle the error #>
///         case .finished:
///             <# maybe do something on completion #>
///     }
/// })
/// ```
///
/// For these closure-based functions that use ``XPCClient/XPCSequentialResponseHandler``, they will be passed a ``SequentialResult`` with the
/// `Success` value matching the route's `sequentialReplyType`. If the sequence fails then a `Failure` of type ``XPCError`` will be passed and this
/// will terminate the sequence. If the sequence completed successfully then ``SequentialResult/finished`` will be passed. Whether a sequence ever
/// completes is determined by the implementation registered with the server or if a client side error occurs during decoding.
